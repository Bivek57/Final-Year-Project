                        process. Customers can also buy and sell cars online. <br> Many clients are perplexed when
                        purchasing a new vehicle. They can't make up their minds on which car is better for them. As a
                        result, there will be a form for them to fill out describing their priorities and requirements
                        for their car. It will also include customer's budget, their contact information and the cars

                        their used car pictures, including its details and contact information, after logging into the
                        website. The vehicle will be listed on the used market, and customers who visit the website will
                        be able to buy or sell their vehicle online. They donâ€™t need to visit re-condition house to sell
